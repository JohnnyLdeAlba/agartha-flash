# Agartha 2.0 Flash

A prototype game engine made in 2013 that was written in ActionScript (Flash). Features a single level, a few enemies and power ups. This was designed for a [game demo](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-html5) built in 2010 that was never completed.

# What's Different from the HTML5 version?
- Sound FX
- A manager that tracks NPCs and projectiles and despawns them when they are out of range.
- The player can create multiple bombs or projectiles at a time.

# Why was this Abandoned?

I loved ActionScript and I felt Flash as a platform was a great. Unfortunatly I didn't do my research when I designed this engine: Adobe at the time had just announced they'll be discontinuing Flash. Today there is no way to run it at all except through legacy means. 

# Known Issues

This version of Agartha was written in ActionScript and designed to run off a server through the browser using Adobe Flash. Because Flash is no longer supported and legacy emulators do not support ActionScript 4 yet, the only way to play this is through a legacy browser that supports Adobe Flash.
