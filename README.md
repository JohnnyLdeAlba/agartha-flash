# Agartha 2.0 Flash

A prototype game engine made in 2013 that was written in ActionScript (Flash). Features a single level, a few enemies and power ups. This was designed for a [game demo](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-html5) built in 2010 that was never completed.

# Known Issues

This version of Agartha was written in ActionScript and designed to run off a server through the browser using Adobe Flash. Because Flash is no longer supported and legacy emulators do not support ActionScript 4 yet, the only way to play this is through a legacy browser that supports Adobe Flash.
